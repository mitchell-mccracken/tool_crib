# TOOL CRIB README FILE

## App to track and log tools in a machine shop
This app will be used to create, read, edit, and delete information related to machine shop tools. The app allows anyone to view the tool inventory without logging in order to create, edit or delete tools an account and login is required.

## Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express
* Heroku

## Areas for Improvement:
* dropdown list for edit.ejs - I created an extra list item based on what the original value was so it would always show the current tool type. This is a bandaid and I would like to implement a better method for this.
* filter options from /tools page (index) - This would be used to allow user to filter tools by tool type which is the original reason I chose to use a dropdown menu.
* bug 1 - app breaks when a duplicate user is created. I think this is something that could be solved in a few lines of code.
